Special Thanks to Herq! 🙌

I would like to sincerely thank Herq for the invaluable help in launching my blog on GitHub Pages.

Thanks to his detailed, step-by-step guide, I successfully managed to:
	•	Open the repository in Visual Studio Code 🛠️
	•	Create and format my first blog post ✍️
	•	Understand how GitHub Pages and the Chirpy theme work 🌐
	•	Execute all the necessary commands in the terminal without any issues 💻

Herq, I truly appreciate your time, effort, and the complete guide that served as a reliable roadmap for me! 🙏
